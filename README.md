# parallel-smith-waterman
A parallel implementation of Smith-Waterman algorithm  for determining similar regions between two strings of 
nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences.

There three different aproaches:
- Serial (the standard implementation for taking measuerments as a baseline)
- Parallel using OpenMP library 
- Parallel OpenMP with Vectorization
